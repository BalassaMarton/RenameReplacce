# RenameReplace

Dumb text replacer that recursively scans a directory and replaces a string in file contents and file/directory names.

Usage:

RenameReplace \<working dir> \<old text> \<new text>

All non-hidden files and directories in \<working dir> will be scanned and possibly renamed.

You may ask: WHY??? I use this tool to change the root namespace of my Visual Studio solutions. 
Proceed with caution.
